Bourbon States Website

## Description of project
This project serves as the start to a storefront/landing page for Bourbon States. The intent is to display completed work and eventually grow a customer base. The main page (index.html) showcases a gallery and the about page (about.html) has extra information regarding Bourbon States and also a form that will serve as a way for those visiting the site to reach out. If the user properly completes the form on about.html, it will bring up the thanks.html page. 

## Requirement 1 (CSS)
The website contains a menu that collapses into a hamburger button when changing to a mobile screen size from one that is larger. The hamburger button can be clicked to show the navigation options and clicked again to hide them.

## Requirement 2 (Javascript)
On the bottom of the main page (index.html) there is a questions that says "Which state should  you visit next?". If the user clicks this, a name of a state is displayed below. Javascript was used to generate a random number to then select from an array of state names. Each time the button is clicked a random state name is displayed. This is a way for someone visitng the site to become a little more engaged and serves as a little easter egg.

## Requirement 3
A grid layout to change how the images are displayed in the gallery on the index.html page. Based on the size of the display, the images are displayed to better fit the size. The grid used a 12 section area. The majority of the layout used the following: Large screens divided it up into 4 columns (large-3), medium screens into 2 columns (medium-6) and small screens into 1 column (small-12). The number represents quantitiy of the 12 columns that each displayed column will take up. "Medium-6" means the column uses 6 of the 12 available (50% of the screen width). In certain areas, other sizes were used to size content appropriately.

## Optional 4
In the header, used last-child to change the font color of the last item (h2)
